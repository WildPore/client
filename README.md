# Inventory App front-end

This is the front-end repository for my inventory app portfolio project. This app helps manage my family's LED video wall rental business.

## Technical Information

- React
- TypeScript
- `react-router` is the most major third-party library.
- PostCSS is used to allow forthcoming CSS additions to be used (pretty much just nesting declarations.)
